//! Request-scoped audit context threaded from the HTTP layer into domain
//! services.
//!
//! Every audit-writing domain service takes an `&AuditContext` (or owned copy)
//! so that `ip_address` / `user_agent` / actor identity are recorded
//! consistently without each service re-deriving them from `Identity` (which
//! carries no HTTP request data). This is the single, canonical carrier for
//! the actor + request half of a [`NewAuditEvent`](super::NewAuditEvent);
//! target / category / action / details remain the caller's responsibility.
